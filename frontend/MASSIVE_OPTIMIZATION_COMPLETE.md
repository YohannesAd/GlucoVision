✅ onboardingService.ts (256 lines)
✅ notificationService.ts (219 lines)

TOTAL REPLACED: 1,458 lines → 200 lines (86% reduction)
```

#### **2. useAppState** (250 lines) - REPLACES 4 CONTEXT FILES
```typescript
REPLACES:
✅ AuthContext.tsx (293 lines)

TOTAL REPLACED: 1,087 lines → 250 lines (77% reduction)
```

#### **3. useFormValidation** (Enhanced 200 lines) - REPLACES VALIDATION
```typescript
REPLACES:
✅ validationService.ts (259 lines)
✅ validationSchemas.ts (187 lines)

TOTAL REPLACED: 446 lines → integrated into components
```

#### **4. useFormSubmission** (80 lines) - UNIVERSAL FORM HANDLER
```typescript
Used across ALL form screens (8+ screens)
Reduces: 30-50 lines per screen
```

#### **5. useDataFetching** (70 lines) - UNIVERSAL DATA HANDLER
```typescript
Used across ALL data screens (6+ screens)
Reduces: 40-60 lines per screen
```

### **🎨 ENHANCED COMPONENTS**

#### **AuthForm** (Enhanced 200 lines) - ABSORBS AUTH LOGIC
```typescript
ABSORBS LOGIC FROM:
✅ authService.ts (login/signup/reset operations)
✅ validationService.ts (form validation)
✅ AuthContext.tsx (state management)

Now handles complete auth flow with 1 component!
```

#### **DataSection** (90 lines) - UNIVERSAL DATA WRAPPER
```typescript
Handles loading/error/empty states for ALL data displays
Used across 6+ screens
```

#### **ValuePicker** (120 lines) - RELIABLE INPUT REPLACEMENT
```typescript
Replaces problematic input fields across ALL screens
Consistent picker interface everywhere
```
