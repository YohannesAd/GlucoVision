# GlucoVision 🩺📊

An AI-powered mobile app to help diabetic patients track, understand, and manage their blood sugar levels —built with modern, professional technologies and inspired by the developer's own family journey.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

GlucoVision is designed to help diabetic users log their glucose levels, visualize trends, and receive AI-based predictions to better manage their condition.

This project is inspired by my father, who is diabetic, and combines cutting-edge full-stack engineering with practical health AI to solve a real-world problem while showcasing modern development practices.
